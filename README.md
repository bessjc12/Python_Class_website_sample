#Environmental Sustainability Project

This website is a product of a JHU class to demonstrate using open data with Python.  The website displays a research proposal and methodology using skills gained during the class.

The goal is to understand if increased recognition of the importance of environmental sustainability measures are resulting in improvement of environmental health as a result of policy or practice implementations.
